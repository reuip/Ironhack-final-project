Uncover the factors that lead to employee attrition and explore how each feature is co-related with attrition.\n\n**Dataset:** We are using a dataset put up by IBM for our analysis. The dataset contain 35 features along with Attrition target variable. This is a fictional data set created by IBM data scientists. It can be downloaded from the following link\nLink- https://www.ibm.com/communities/analytics/watson-analytics-blog/hr-employee-attrition/ or https://www.kaggle.com/pavansubhasht/ibm-hr-analytics-attrition-dataset\n\n**Methodology:**\n1. Through our analysis we intend to build a model which can predict if an employee is about to quit. \n2. We shall be looking at all variables through some plots and infer about it in our exploratory analysis. \n3. After our exploration we shall build some features based on the variables at hand and take a call on inclusion/exclusion of few variables.","metadata":{"_uuid":"001e3a6d7f7b4e83eaf8fcb1a4b1e643b9f64268"}},{"cell_type":"code","source":"# Loading all the required libraries\n%matplotlib inline\nimport os\nimport pandas as pd\nfrom pandas import ExcelFile\nimport matplotlib.pyplot as plt\nimport numpy as np\nimport seaborn as sns","metadata":{"_uuid":"addd31c379955f9c18d751d1f7806e4d9a3b0ae6"},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"code","source":"# Ignore warnings\nimport warnings\nwarnings.filterwarnings('ignore')\n\n# Settings\nplt.rcParams['axes.labelsize'] = 14\nplt.rcParams['xtick.labelsize'] = 12\nplt.rcParams['ytick.labelsize'] = 12\nplt.rcParams['figure.figsize'] = (16, 4)\n\npd.options.display.max_columns = 500","metadata":{"_uuid":"e193442f76c742f861f4f175bb1a6acd9b74f7bc"},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"## Step 2 - Understand the Data\nLet's look how many observations and features are present in complete dataset.

We need to keep in mind that our focus should be to have a better accuracy of predicting attrition i.e. Attrition = 1 which in confusion matrix will be \"True Positive\". However, we should not forget the prediction accuracy of not qualifying for attrition i.e. Attrition = 0 which will be \"True Negative\" in confusion matrix.\n\nSo, we need to focus on four parameters:\n- **Accuracy:** Overall, how often is the classifier correct? i.e {(TP+TN)/Total}\n- **True Positive Rate:** When it's actually yes, how often does it predict yes? default_ind = 1, {TP/Actual YES}, this is also known as \"Sensitivity\" or \"Recall\"\n- **Precision:** When it predicts yes, how often is it correct? i.e. {TP/(TP+FP)}\n- **Specificity:** When it's actually no, how often does it predict no? default_ind = 0, {TN/actual NO}\n- **Cross Validation Score:** Cross Validation is a technique which involves reserving a particular sample of a dataset on which you do not train the model. Later, you test your model on this sample before finalizing it. Do this for k folds and take mean of accuracy scores of the k fold models.\n- **F1 Score:** This is a weighted average of the true positive rate (recall) and precision.\n- **ROC Curve:** This is a commonly used graph that summarizes the performance of a classifier over all possible thresholds. It is generated by plotting the True Positive Rate (y-axis) against the False Positive Rate (x-axis) as you vary the threshold for assigning observations to a given class. \n\nAbove information was taken and more details can be found at https://www.dataschool.io/simple-guide-to-confusion-matrix-terminology/\n\n### Step 5.1 - Prepare Train & Test Dataset\nThe data should be divided into train and test data.
