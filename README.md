# Ironhack-final-project

# Plan


## Initial data exploration and cleaning
- Checking data for missing values, mislabelled values, fixing things
- Checking columns for unnecessary features (e.g. ID)
- Cleaning and standardizing categorical data for consistency


## EDA
- Gathering descriptive statistics about population
- Exploring relationships between target variable (Attrition) and other variables.  
- Conducting group-by's to find differences between those who stay and those who don't across features

## Feature engineering
- Determining which features can be added/created from existing data.

## Preparing data for modelling
- Running histograms, correcting skew in data if needed
- Replacing null values
- Separating numerical and categorical data for analysis

## Modelling 
- X/Y train/test splits
- Transform data (depending on analysis)
- Feature selection methods (if necessary)
- Determine which modelling approach gives best results

## Results gathering
- Summarizing learnings from modelling
- Summarizing learnings from EDA
- Determining recommendations and next steps for the company
